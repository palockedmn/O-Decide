# O-Decide

A simple and useless program to decide whether or not you're allowed to orgasm. Tweak the settings to customize your experience, then click decide to let the computer choose. If your computer gives you permission, congrats! If not, you'll have to wait until the time you set expires before you can try again! Kinda fun to make, figured I'd share.
